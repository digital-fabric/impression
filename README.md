## What is Impression

> Impression is still in a very early stage of development. Things might not
> correctly, or not at all.

Impression is a modern web framework for Ruby. Unlike other web framework,
Impression does not impose any rigid structure or paradigm, but instead provides
a set of tools letting you build any kind of web app, by freely mixing different
kinds of web resources, be they static files, structured templates, Jamstack
sites, or dynamic APIs.

In Impression, resources can be composed into a hierarchical tree, allowing
combining of multiple web apps, or web subsystems, into a single URL hierarchy.

Impression is made for running on top of
[Tipi](https://github.com/digital-fabric/tipi), a new all-in-one web server for
Ruby.
